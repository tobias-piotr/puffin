# 🐧 Puffin

Sending emails made complicated.

Puffin is a REST API made with Go and Chi, that allows to prepare email templates and send them on demand via API call. The main idea was to implement an API, gRPC, and some dashboard with templ and htmx. Eventually, only the first part was made, but maybe the project will be finished one day (for sure).
